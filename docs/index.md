<h1 align="center">lcpy Documentation</h1>

Welcome to the lcpy documentation. Here, we show how to use the library!

## Values

If you know the basics, here are the values you can use:

* `true`
* `false`
* `none`
* `exception`

## Using

Usage is very simple, just add the following to your imports:

```python
from lcpy import field
```

Simply change `field` to one of the [values we have](#values).
For example:

```python
# only import one
from lcpy import true

# import multiple
from lcpy import false, none
```

Simple as that.
