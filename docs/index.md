Welcome to the lcpy documentation. Here we show how to install, use, and contribute to the library.

## Values

If you know the basics, here are the values you can use:

* `true`
* `false`
* `none`

## Using

Usage is very simple, just add the following to your imports:

```python
from lcpy import field
```

Simply change `field` to one of the [values we have](#values). (For example: `true` or `false, none`)
